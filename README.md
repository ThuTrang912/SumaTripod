## Initializing the Flutter Project
The Flutter project has been initialized using the `flutter create` command. The project structure is as follows:

```
my_app/
├── android/
├── ios/
├── lib/
│   ├── main.dart
│   └── ...
├── test/
├── pubspec.yaml
└── ...
```

Got it, here's the updated section:

## Integrating YOLOv5 for Object Detection
To enable object detection in the app, the YOLOv5 model is being integrated. The team has referenced the [YOLOv5 GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to integrate the object detection functionality. The source code for the YOLOv5 integration can be found in the `` directory.

## Implementing Object Tracking
The object tracking functionality is currently being implemented. The code for the object tracking feature is located in the `` directory.

## Running and Testing the App
The app can be run using the `flutter run` command. Testing is being performed to ensure the object detection and tracking features are working as expected.
